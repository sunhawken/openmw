-- Seconds behind the newest snapshot. THE LARGEST SINGLE LATENCY ITEM in the system: unlike
-- every rate upstream of it, this is unconditionally additive to what the player sees. 75 ms
-- is safe only because actor frames now arrive on a stable ~50 ms cadence (the peer broadcasts
-- every frame at its framerate cap, with no aliasing gate). The floor is one packet interval
-- plus the delivery hop plus jitter; go lower only with evidence that arrivals are steadier,
-- or puppets clamp to the newest sample and stall on a laggy link instead of interpolating.
