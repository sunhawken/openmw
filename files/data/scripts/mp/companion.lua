-- table lookup per second, and it says nothing at all unless the answer CHANGED.

-- sits inactive for its whole life while the companion stands exactly where it was recruited.
-- Single player never sees it because you recruit face to face. Here the claim travels client
-- -> server -> holder and companion.lua polls at 1 Hz, so the leader (on the peer an AVATAR,
-- a Generated: NPC) can legitimately be a thousand units away by the time the package lands --
-- recruit someone and walk off briskly and the follower never takes a step.
--
-- So: while the actor has NOT moved and its leader is back in range, hand the engine a fresh
-- Follow package and let it run its own activation check again. AiEscort has no such latch
-- (isInEscortRange is re-tested every frame and the package resumes on its own), so Follow is
-- the only one re-issued -- which also means an escort's destination is never touched.
