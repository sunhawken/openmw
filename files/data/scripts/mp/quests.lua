-- Sharing the journal and not the topics is the inconsistent position, not this.
--
-- TES3MP synced these too and earned "server freezes caused by infinite topic packet spam
-- from local scripts" for it. Three things keep that from happening here:
--   * only ADDITIONS are sent, diffed against a set, so a steady state is silent;
--   * an applied REMOTE topic is written into that set BEFORE it is added to the journal, so
--     it is never seen as a local discovery and echoed back -- which is the actual mechanism
--     of a packet storm between two clients, not volume;
--   * they ride the same slow diff beat as globals, factions and bounty.

-- data, the topics a player has accumulated dialogue ENTRIES for. Measured directly
-- (s75-topic-probe): five real topic records added, zero engine complaints, nothing visible
-- here afterwards.
--
-- So a topic learned the way a PLAYER learns one (by talking, which records entries) is
-- broadcast normally, and a topic added programmatically is invisible to this diff. That left
-- the sync untestable: s73 drove learning with addTopic and then polled this collection, so it
-- could never observe its own input and skipped for months behind a wrong explanation.
--
-- This set lets a scenario say "treat this as locally learned" and exercise the REAL path from
-- there: diff -> send -> server relay -> receiver applies. What it does not simulate is the
