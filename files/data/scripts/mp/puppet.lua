-- puppets walk/run/jump like real actors instead of gliding between set positions. On

-- saving: an actor that is never commanded to move stands in an idle animation and does no
-- per-frame movement solve, whereas a steered one runs the character controller, blends
-- locomotion animation and sweeps physics every single frame. What it costs is smooth

-- second measured WORSE than doing nothing clever at all, because ~30 actors/second were
-- being re-placed in the world. The saving comes from repositioning RARELY, not from
-- skipping the character controller, so a tighter threshold does not buy accuracy: it buys
-- a slower client.
--
-- The absolute figures that observation was first made against were taken on a contended
-- box and were an order of magnitude too high; see server/README.md for the corrected

-- held up on re-measurement — frequent repositioning is still the expensive path — which is
