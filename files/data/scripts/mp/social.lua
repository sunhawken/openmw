--
-- Built to read like the engine's own Options window (see scripts/mp/ui.lua): a large,
-- centred, fixed-footprint frame with a title, a tab strip whose selected tab is filled, its
-- content grouped into bordered panels, and a footer bar with the dismiss button — GMST font
-- colours and real spacing throughout, so it is native by resemblance, not a debug overlay.
--
-- Identity on the wire is the ACCOUNT KEY (`acct`), never the player id: ids are
-- per-session, so an id-keyed friend would vanish on every reconnect.
