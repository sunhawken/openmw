-- own untouched combat pipeline (files/data-mw/scripts/omw/combat/local.lua).
--

-- (openmw_aux.util.callEventHandlers iterates in reverse) and our script attaches at
-- runtime, ours runs FIRST and returns false — cancelling all local damage — after
-- forwarding the raw attack here.
-- Inbound: we re-emit the stock `Hit` local event on the real victim, so the builtin
-- pipeline runs verbatim for our own player and for actors under our authority.
