# Changelog

Notable changes to OpenMW-Web. Dates are release dates, newest first.

## Unreleased: Jolt / Ragdoll edition

**The engine is now the `official-jolt-ragdoll` fork.** Physics runs on Jolt instead of Bullet,
with ragdolls on death, loose items and ingredients as simulated bodies that float, Jiggle,
Wiggle and Verlet cloth secondary motion (each with its own settings tab), masked occlusion
culling, directional mouse-flick melee and the fork's other additions. The browser-specific
changes it needed (one Jolt worker thread, SIMD128 builds of Jolt and the occlusion rasterizer, a
1 MB stack) and the build-script changes are in [`JOLT_RAGDOLL_PORT.md`](JOLT_RAGDOLL_PORT.md).
Not yet baked or playtested in a browser.

## 1.4.1

**Nobody can hide the world from everybody.** A client may toggle refs in cells it is nowhere
near -- that is how Morrowind's own scripts work, disabling a hundred quest refs across the
island as your game loads -- and the disable half of that message hides a door, a shopkeeper or
a quest trigger for *every* player who walks in afterwards, permanently. There was nothing
stopping a stream of them. The reveal is untouched; the hiding is budgeted: the world-load
burst (about a hundred refs, twice over) is free, and past it twelve a minute, logged with a
moderation note. Bounded rather than ended, honestly: ending it needs the server to know which
refs the content's own scripts toggle.

**The one-cell load soak runs again.** It had been dead since the peer took over simulation --
it waited to be handed authority over the cell it was crowding, which no player is ever given
now -- and died on a timeout that named nothing. It asks who holds the cell instead, and a
standalone run brings its own holder.

Also: the peer says what an avatar was left able to do after shedding items it should not have
(encumbrance, capacity, walk speed), read a frame later so the number is the result rather than
the thing about to change.

## 1.4.0

Multiplayer, played to the end. Every scenario in the browser suite -- 126 of them, two real
browsers and a simulating peer each -- passes on one build, and a fresh-install rehearsal (empty
directory, wizard, restart, launcher sign-in, a session with a friend: walk, fight, loot, drown,
relog, the host drops and comes back, both exit) runs green after it. What that took, in the
order a player would meet it:

**The world is simulated for everyone by one body.** The server's own peer runs an avatar for
each player and every NPC; your browser drives yours with raw input and is reconciled to what
the peer says happened. Melee, ranged, magic, falls, drowning, encumbrance, sneak attacks,
on-strike enchantments, deaths and respawns are resolved once, on the peer, and shown to every
screen the same way. A body ruled by the peer takes no local damage twice.

**A peer restart no longer moves anyone.** The replacement peer spawned every avatar the frame
it joined and streamed their poses the same tick -- before the bodies were placed, so it said
(0,0,0) for everyone and players with a hand on the keys were snapped to the middle of the sea.
An unplaced avatar is not streamed. A killed NPC stays dead across the restart, on every screen.

**Leaving means leaving.** The in-game Exit told the server it was going and then left the page
150 ms later; on a slow machine the word never got out and a Party host's friends sat ninety
seconds in a hostless world before being sent home. Exit now waits for the notice to go out.
A self-initiated disconnect closes its own socket; F5 rejoins the same world in the same role;
a resume that names a still-open session takes it over in place.

**Sound could freeze the game.** A teleport gave a sound source a velocity of thousands of
units per second, the Doppler clamp turned that into Infinity, and WebAudio threw on a
non-finite playback rate -- the engine stopped mid-frame. Every value handed to the audio
layer is finite and sane now.

**Puppets and avatars behave like players.** They carry the torch their owner holds at noon
(the NPC daytime rule unequipped it), swing from eye height with their owner's pitch so a scrib
is hittable, keep their equipment through a slow join, and the "can this actor look down" and
"who is in range" gates the engine reserved for the local player apply to them.

**Hosting.** Nobody who self-hosts compiles anything: the release publishes the server image to
ghcr.io. A server with no peer configured says so at once instead of holding every join. Bans
reach every world; erasing an account erases its credentials; a mod with hundreds of loose
assets is packed into one archive at install; the dashboard's "respawn here" sets a real point.

**Death, where you come back.** With no configured respawn point you come back where you fell;
under the sea that means the surface, not the seabed again (six deaths in three minutes).

The full accounting -- what each of the 130 scenarios proves and why -- is in
server/docs/MP-BACKLOG.md rows 355-507 and MP-COVERAGE-MAP.md.

## 1.3.4

Multiplayer had never simulated a world on a released image. Found by playing the game as a
player — signing in at the front door with a username and a password, on a server hosting the
files — rather than by reading it or running the suite.

**The simulation peer could not start. At all.** 1.3.2 correctly made the entrypoint drop
privileges, so the server runs as an ordinary user; the peer still inherited `HOME=/root`, and
OpenMW resolves its data path from `HOME` before reading a line of config. It died with
`Permission denied [/root/.local/share/openmw/data]` and respawned in a loop. Nothing about
that reaches the player: the world is up, they join it, and they sit on "waiting for the world
to be simulated" for ever with no NPCs, because a cell only gets an authority holder when a
peer takes it. The server reports itself healthy throughout.

**Players were asked to upload a game the server already serves.** `/locker/needed` answers
"which files does this world load", built from the operator's own install, and the client reads
it as "which files must be in my locker". Those are the same list only when the player is the
one supplying the game — so a server-hosted deployment showed a six-file, half-gigabyte upload
checklist for a game the operator had installed once for everybody.

**And the flag that fixes it was dead on arrival.** The game page has always understood a
"the server holds the data" marker and nothing ever set it — because it could not work: the
multiplayer branch scrubs the URL fragment the moment it reads the sign-in ticket, and the line
reading the marker looked at the fragment afterwards.

**A deploy could reach half a client.** The app shell was served with no cache directive, so
browsers cached it heuristically: the launcher would update while the game page stayed stale,
and the two then disagreed about the fragment they hand each other. The shells revalidate now;
the engine stays cached, since a stale one is refused loudly by its hash instead of
misbehaving quietly.

**Dying on a real server sent you to a cell that does not exist.** The shipped respawn point is
the Example Suite village. The server warned about that at every boot and then used it anyway,
teleporting the first player who died into the demo's coordinates. On real content it is now
treated as unset, which puts them back where they fell — somewhere that exists — and the
dashboard's "respawn here" sets a real one in a click.

**Every abandoned sign-in leaked a world.** A world is created before Morrowind's character
creation finishes, so backing out of chargen made one, and the reaper stopped the process while
leaving the directory. Five of them on a fresh box, none running, against a capacity of twelve.
Worlds nobody ever joined now take their directory with them; a world that was played keeps its
data exactly as before.

New browser scenario: the front door. Every existing scenario boots the game page directly with
an auto-login, which is a side door built for tests — so the sign-in a real player uses, and
the locker gate behind it, had never been exercised by anything. That is why all of the above
survived 1052 unit tests, 70 browser scenarios and three deploy health gates.

1052 server tests, 0 failed.

## 1.3.3

Found by running it, not by reading it. 1.3.2 fixed what the two programs disagreed about;
1.3.3 is what a player and an operator actually hit when you walk the product end to end.

**A friend handed the server address could not get in.** The Multiplayer card offered three
greyed-out "Soon" buttons and told them to ask the operator to enable a sign-in method. The
operator had already enabled one: `/auth/providers` has always reported `allowPasswordLogin`
beside the provider list, and the launcher read only the list. Password sign-in now renders
there and hands off through the same path the SSO redirect takes, so character select and world
dial-in stay one path rather than two that drift.

**The page described a different server from the one the operator set up.** Under "your game
data" it told players they would upload their own Data Files to a personal locker — on a server
whose operator had just chosen "served by this server" and installed Morrowind once for
everyone. It asks the server now: the manifest route answers 404 unless this server serves the
game, so its status is the answer.

**Adding a friend handed them the dashboard.** There is no self-serve sign-up on a password
server, so "add someone" is where a friend's account comes from — and its access list held only
viewer, moderator and owner. Every player an operator added got a login to the admin dashboard.
"Player" is now offered, and is the default.

**Settings the operator can answer, and none they cannot.** Free text became dropdowns wherever
the parser already has an enum, fed by one map so the two cannot drift. Fields the wizard
derives are refused at the endpoint rather than merely hidden. Respawn stopped asking for four
coordinates nobody knows — the operator points at a standing player instead, which is by
construction a place a person can stand and works for vanilla, mods and Tamriel Rebuilt alike.

**State nobody owned.** A client could invent unlimited weather regions, each one a row written
to disk and replayed at every future joiner. Chat had no rate limit despite the protocol
promising one, so a client sitting just under the message budget reached every player on the
world indefinitely. The clock's day rollover gave up past ~18,000 hours and left the hour out of
range on disk, reachable from a plugin or from a tick after the host machine slept — time the
server was not running is not time that passed in the world. The who-is-playing map was swept
for tokens but never for its own entries.

**The two halves of the server disagreed about how long a month is.** One collapsed the calendar
assuming twelve 28-day months while the clock rolled the real Morrowind lengths, so the count
ran backwards leaving a 31-day month — and a merchant drained near a boundary stayed drained for
up to three game days.

**An optional browser binding could stop a player reporting movement.** The page bridge is
Emscripten-only and was called on the first line of `onFrame`, so on any engine without it the
throw took movement, equipment and barter reporting down with it for the whole session.

**The player cap is the operator's number again.** 1.3.2 clamped it to a hidden 32 while
`/status` still advertised what was configured; the clamp is gone and capacity is enforced once,
against the same field that is advertised. And since 1.2.0 the locker origin was never offered
at all — right when the wizard captured a domain and derived it, wrong on the one path that
captures none, where the base falls back to loopback and the server's own warning named a field
the dashboard refused to accept.

Fourteen server-to-client events existed only in the source, so a coverage audit built from the
protocol document skipped every one of them. They are documented, and the ones that had no test
have one. The boot-performance gate stopped gating on a ratio that moved 10% with machine load
and in the wrong direction for its own purpose.

1050 server tests, 64 browser scenarios green on real clients.

## 1.3.2

Thirteen defects, most of them one shape: something wired into one of the two programs and not
the other, or a rule enforced in the view and not at the door.

**What an operator hits.** The multiplayer server never served the game files they uploaded, so
players were asked to supply a game the operator had already provided. Switching to the image
with the engine — which `docker-compose.yml` tells you to do — made every existing file
unreadable, because the two images ran as different uids; the entrypoint repairs ownership and
drops privileges now. The multiplayer server never regenerated its proxy config at boot, so a
restored backup or a changed answer never took effect. Password-reset mail pointed at loopback
on any server with a domain. The deployment shape (mode, hosting, domain, port, content profile)
was editable from the settings page, which changed the record and did none of the work the
wizard does — `setup.completed` was one PUT from reopening first-run setup on a live server.

**What a player hits.** A friend request to someone in their own game was stored and never
delivered; the row that did arrive named them by their account key, which for an SSO account is
a real name; and it could not be accepted, because the accept resolved names against the local
roster. An invite across worlds was never delivered either, and an invite from a friend vanished
from the panel within ten seconds because every snapshot deleted it. A full world told the
owner's friend it was private, at a seat count nobody advertised.

**What an operator never sees until it matters.** A world that wedged while occupied was never
reaped, holding its port, its slot and its memory until the gateway restarted. The log wrote
credentials to all three sinks, and measured its own file with a syscall on every line. A
signed-in player could hold unlimited upload authorisations.

Eight new browser scenarios cover paths that had none: server-hosted game files, blocking,
cross-world invites, the operator's platform actions, closing your world on guests, reports,
ban/unban, and maintenance. Two of that release's bugs were found by them.

1033 server tests, 54 browser scenarios, mode flip proven on both images.

## 1.3.1

One way in, for operators and for players. 1.3.0 made the world shareable; 1.3.1 settles who
administers it and from where.

**The setup wizard now starts the server it names.** Choosing single player or multiplayer used
to be recorded as a setting and nothing else: which program ran was decided by a marker file
nothing in the code ever wrote, so the answer was inert. The wizard writes that marker and the
restart it asks for brings the container back on the other program. It works on the hosted image
too, where a pinned command had been ignoring the marker entirely — that image now defaults to
the multiplayer server, exactly what it always ran, so a deploy still changes nothing by itself.
The multiplayer answer needs no environment flag any more; multiplayer is finished.

**The dashboard runs on the multiplayer server.** It never had one. The things it administers —
roster, moderation, mods, settings — belong to a game, and the supervisor has none of its own,
so switching a container to multiplayer left the operator with a 404 and a shell as the only way
back. It now serves the same dashboard, people first: who is playing and in whose game, then the
games, then how full the box is. Each game's pages open through a proxy under one sign-in, so a
kick is two clicks from a player's name rather than a different URL and another password.

**Operator commands have one door.** The in-game admin window, the typed `/slash` path and the
`AdminCommand` event are gone; a chat line starting with "/" is chat. Everything an operator can
do goes through the dashboard console and the single gate behind it, which was always where the
rank check and the audit line lived. A second route to the same actions was a second place for
that check to be wrong, and one of them ran on the player's own machine.

**Players get the social half back, in the panel.** Reporting was a typed command; muting and
blocking could be done from a row and undone from nowhere; the privacy control lived in a window
that had stopped drawing. Report (with a reason), unblock, unmute and who-can-see-me are all in
the O panel now, and the report still carries the surrounding chat to whoever reads the queue.

**The page and the game speak properly.** The browser sent commands through a single slot the
engine drained about once a frame, so two commands in the same frame silently destroyed one —
which is how a test once reported "my attacks do nothing" against a server that was fine. It is
a queue now, drained whole each frame, and every command is acknowledged, so a caller learns
whether the thing it asked for actually ran.

**Operational gaps closed.** The multiplayer server keeps its own log history on disk and serves
it on the Logs page (lifecycle events used to vanish on the restart you wanted to read them
after), and it sends the same notifications a game does, so `world.*` and `gateway.*` events can
reach an inbox or a webhook.

## 1.3.0

The multiplayer overhaul. 1.2.0 made the server something a person runs from a browser; 1.3.0
makes the world something several people can actually share: one simulating peer per world
holds every occupied cell and every player's body, movement is input-authoritative, and there
are no client-side saves to fork the world.

**The world reacts to you now.** Guards pursue a wanted player (they evaluated a bounty that
belonged to nobody before), levelled spawns match the nearest player's level instead of a
level-1 dummy, difficulty scaling applies to real players, and training or levelling reaches the
peer the moment it happens instead of the next time you picked something up.

**Picking up an item is a request.** Two players reaching for the same item used to both keep
it. The server now answers, the loser is told so, and containers and loose items behave alike.

**Bars, death and respawn are real.** Health, magicka and fatigue reached nobody for as long as
the peer has existed (a wire-name mismatch), respawn left you a corpse with healthy bars, a
returning peer dropped every body at the world origin, and every puppet stopped short of where
its player actually stood at the end of every walk. All fixed, and every one of them has a
browser scenario now, because none of them could be seen from the unit tier.

**Sim peers actually stop now.** The headless engine ignores SIGTERM, and the server only ever
sent SIGTERM -- so every reaped or released peer lived on as a ~360 MB zombie that also kept
its world from ever getting a peer again and counted against `maxPeers`. Stops escalate to
SIGKILL; shutdown kills outright. The deploy's protocol health check also walks the real path
now: it creates a world as the platform, which spawns a world process and its sim peer, then
dials it.

Server 1014/1020 (6 env-skips), Lua 92/92, browser 53 pass / 1 fail / 4 skip of 58 -- the one fail, if any, is s71, a three-client scenario over this laptop's memory ceiling (documented in STATUS.md). Solo and Party worlds; 32 players per world.

## 1.2.0

The dashboard release. 1.1.0 put a multiplayer service around the engine; 1.2.0 makes the
whole server something a person runs from a browser: setup is a wizard, mods are installed
and ordered on a page, Tamriel Rebuilt has a path of its own, and the unfinished parts say
so instead of waiting to be discovered.

**Updating is a button now.** The Updates page shows what you run and what is newest, for
both halves: the server and the game client. Clicking Update on the client makes the server
download the release, verify it against the release checksums, and swap it in with no
restart - players simply get the new version on their next page load. Clicking Update on the
server hands the job to a new updater container in the compose stack, which checks out the
newest release tag, rebuilds, and restarts, streaming its phases to the page. Nothing is
automatic: checking is, applying never. Updates do not touch the data folder, so accounts,
saves, settings, game files and mods stay put. Existing deployments gain all this with a
one-time `git pull` and `docker compose up -d --build`; `setup.sh --update`, which used to
run a `docker compose pull` that could never update anything, now does the same tag-pinned
checkout the updater does.

**Installing a big mod is minutes, not an hour, and it shows a real progress bar.** Tamriel
Data is 54,000 files, and 7z writing them through Docker Desktop's file sharing was measured
at 60+ minutes — extraction now happens on the container's own disk (about three minutes) and
the files are copied onto the game-data folder sixteen at a time (measured 108 s, against
756 s one at a time), because that layer charges per round trip rather than per byte. While it
runs, the page polls the server for 7z's own extraction percentage and a placed-file count,
so the phase card shows a moving bar instead of a spinner; Back and Skip are disabled until it
finishes.

**The delivery question is gone: the server supplies the game files.** The wizard no longer
asks how players get their copy, and the dashboard no longer offers the setting. The old
"everyone brings their own copy" answer — each player uploading their own Data Files to a
per-account locker on the server — belongs to the game launcher, not the server setup, and
its experimental flag went with it. A config that already says "verify" is still honoured at
runtime.

**A server nobody configured answers on plain HTTP.** First contact was a certificate
warning; now http://localhost/admin just works, with https://localhost still answering
self-signed for browsers that remember it. The wizard's hosting answer sets the real posture
and the page hands you to whichever address that creates.

**Maintenance mode is hidden on single-player servers**, where it had nothing to do: the
switch refuses multiplayer connections and disconnects the roster, and in single player
neither exists — the page claimed to close doors it cannot reach.

**Small wizard honesty:** only the current step is named on the progress rail; the Tamriel
Rebuilt chooser ticks every part by default except ones named as removers; and the
internal-hosting lecture about shared memory moved out of the wizard into the docs.

**The logo is the actual Virtastic mark everywhere**, favicons included, and og.png was
regenerated from the brand asset.

**Setting a server up no longer involves a terminal.** `./setup.sh` starts the stack and opens
a browser, and everything after that is a wizard: the administrator account, single player or
multiplayer, how people sign in, who may register, which edition of Morrowind this is, whether
players bring their own copy or the server hands one out, how the server is reached, where
uploads are stored, and the game files themselves. Answers are written to the same
configuration a hand-editor would have produced, and every one of them can be changed
afterwards from Settings. A server set up from outside its own network is additionally asked
for a setup key, printed at startup and saved to the data folder, so the first stranger to find
`/admin` cannot claim it; from your own machine or LAN you are never asked.

**The unfinished answers are shown, greyed out, and off until you ask for them.** Multiplayer,
and the delivery answer where each player uploads their own copy of the game here and streams it
from their own storage, are both real and both rough, and both were offered in the wizard beside
answers that have been exercised for months. They are now disabled by default and marked
experimental, with `OMW_EXPERIMENTAL=multiplayer,playerUploads` (or `all`) turning on whichever
you want. The delivery answer where this server publishes the copy you uploaded is a static file
route, and stays an ordinary choice. They are shown
rather than hidden on purpose: an operator who came here for multiplayer and finds no mention
of it concludes they have the wrong software, where a greyed tile naming the variable answers
the question they actually have. Only a **new** setup is affected; a server already configured
for any of them keeps running, and the server refuses a gated answer even when it is submitted
without the page.

**A server can be reached over plain HTTP on a port you choose.** The hosting question used to
assume the internet. Answering "internal or behind your own proxy" now takes a port number and
configures the bundled proxy for plain HTTP, which is what a home network, a LAN party, a
tunnel, or your own reverse proxy in front actually wants. The page says plainly which browsers
will refuse that: the engine needs shared memory, which browsers grant only on a secure origin,
so `http://localhost` is fine and `http://` to an IP or a machine name is not.

**Mods install from the dashboard, in an order you control.** Drop a `.zip` or a `.7z` in and
the server reads what is inside it, shows you the data folders it found with their plugins and
asset directories, and installs the ones you tick, each into its own folder. There is a list
with the mods in load order: drag to reorder, switch one off without removing it, untick a
single plugin to keep a mod's assets and skip its plugin, or remove it entirely. Nexus has no
packaging standard, so a download routinely carries a core install plus optional extras;
installing all of them silently is how a game ends up broken somewhere far from the mod that
did it.

**The dashboard says what overwrites what, while you are dragging.** Two mods providing the
same file is normal and usually deliberate, and OpenMW's rule is that the one later in the list
wins. Each mod now carries badges for how many files it replaces and how many of its own are
overridden, with the pairs spelled out per mod, and they are recomputed as the list moves
rather than describing the order the page was loaded with. A plugin whose master is not loaded
is called out separately and in red, because that one is not a preference: the engine aborts at
startup and the player sees a black screen.

**Tamriel Rebuilt has a setup path of its own.** It is a separate download from the game, in
two archives (the landmass and its assets), and neither is part of a `Data Files` folder, so
choosing that edition previously left a server that reported itself complete and ran plain
Morrowind. The wizard now asks for the archives, and identifies which release they are by the
SHA-256 of the file rather than its name, because release names vary and every browser and chat
client renames a download. A release the table has not been told about installs exactly the
same and says so; refusing anything newer than a hard-coded list would be worse than not naming
it. A plugin missing its master is reported by name, which is what catches the assets archive
being forgotten.

**Archives up to 100,000 files are accepted, and big uploads are not cut off.** The reader
stopped at 20,000 entries, which is under half of Tamriel Data; a listing too large to read was
silently truncated, so an archive could install looking complete with its last files missing;
and Node's five-minute request cap aborted any upload slower than that, which on a 2.7 GB
archive is most connections that are not localhost. All three are fixed, and the guard against
a client dribbling headers forever is untouched.

**An operator can see, export and import a player's savegames.** Support for "my save is gone"
previously meant shell access to the storage backend. Saves are listed per account with their
sizes and dates, downloadable as a file, and restorable by upload, with the quota enforced on
the way in.

**Streamed game data stops being re-downloaded every session.** The engine reads its data in
chunks over HTTP Range, and browsers do not put range responses in the ordinary HTTP cache, so
roughly 300 MB was fetched again on every boot no matter what the server's cache headers said.
Chunks now persist in the Cache API, keyed so that a re-signed storage URL still hits and a
replaced file does not.

**The public world stops leaking items into real characters.** It is a social lobby with no
quest progress and no stakes, but inventory persisted straight out of it — and quest items
never deplete from a container, so any number of strangers could each take the same artifact
and keep it forever. The guard that was supposed to prevent this claimed the lobby was safe
because its cells reset; no cells were configured to reset, so nothing did. The lobby now
persists nothing at all: you arrive with your gear, play, and leave with exactly what you had,
losses included. A reconnect inside the resume window still puts you back where you were.

**Multiplayer capacity is governed by measured memory, not by a count.** Every occupied world
runs its own headless simulation peer, so worlds multiply that cost rather than sharing it. The
gateway had a cap derived from the player limit — 256 worlds against a container sized for
about two — on the explicit reasoning that peers were capped separately, which was the opposite
of the truth. There is now a memory budget (`[worlds] memBudgetMb`), the binding ceiling is
logged at boot and reported on `/healthz`, and a player who cannot get in is told the server
is full instead of being left retrying. The per-world cost it divides by was measured on a real
Linux container with real game data — 623 MB, against the 780 MB previously assumed from two
figures in comments.

**Party difficulty scaling is off by default.** Scaling enemies to the party is something a
group can now choose rather than something that happens to them; friends mostly want to play
Morrowind together, not to have it quietly made harder.

**Dying near your friends puts you back near your friends.** Death respawned every player at a
fixed pair of coordinates that were only ever meant as a demo placeholder — a spot outside Seyda
Neen, wherever in Vvardenfell you actually died. A party member who fell in a Telvanni tower was
sent across the map and the session was effectively over for them. You now come back beside a
living party member if there is one, at the operator's configured point if they set one, and
otherwise where you fell; and the rest of the party is told you went down instead of silently
losing you. An operator who leaves the placeholder configured on a real world is now warned at
startup rather than discovering it through a player.

**Party settings stop lying about themselves.** The leader could toggle gold splitting and rare-item
rolls, but the update sent to everyone afterwards carried none of those values — so each client
kept rendering whatever it had assumed at join, the buttons showed the wrong state, and toggling
one appeared to do nothing. The settings now travel with the update, difficulty scaling is a
button beside the others rather than a server-only setting, and the result of a rare-item roll is
announced to the party instead of being resolved in silence.

**Attacks are always forwarded when the target can be addressed.** In multiplayer the attacker's
own client cancels its local damage and forwards the raw attack to whoever owns the target, so
anything that then declines to send does not lose a message, it loses the whole swing — no
damage, no miss, no sound. The client used to decline whenever it did not know the target cell's
authority "epoch", a condition the server had long since stopped caring about: it checks that
number only when one is offered, and otherwise proves you were there by how close you stood. The
client now matches that.

Being straight about what this does and does not fix: the case it closes is narrower than it
first appeared. A creature only becomes a remote-controlled puppet in a place whose epoch your
game has already been told, because both arrive in the same message — so the gap is real but
narrow, mostly a creature that has since wandered across a boundary. It is not the explanation
for an attack going nowhere against something standing in front of you.

**Fixed: creatures that would not fight, and one frozen mid-swing.** Away from wherever the
world's simulator happened to be standing, nothing thought at all: creatures never noticed you,
never attacked, and anything already swinging stopped where it was. The engine only runs a
creature's mind if it is close to the player — and on the machine that simulates a shared world
the "player" is that machine's own idle stand-in, parked in one spot. Everyone else's
surroundings were outside the radius, which is under one map square wide. The check now measures
to the nearest place the world is actually being simulated, which is what the matching visibility
check had always done; single-player is unchanged, because there is only ever one such place and
it is you.

**Fixed: the weather forgot itself every time you loaded.** A region's weather is meant to carry
on where it left off — the server stores it when nobody is left in the region and hands it back to
the next person who arrives. It was handing it back correctly and the game was throwing it away.
Whoever is in charge of a region ignores incoming weather for it, so that their own broadcast does
not echo back onto them; the handback arrives a moment after you are put in charge, so it looked
exactly like an echo. Playing alone, that meant every session began by rolling fresh weather and
discarding whatever the world had before.

**Spells work in multiplayer.** They never did. Casting anything harmful at a creature or another
player simply had no effect: your own game worked out the damage and applied it to its local copy
of them, nobody else was ever told, and the health you saw drop sprang back a moment later. Every
mage was playing alone.

The reason was a quiet asymmetry. When you hit something with a weapon the engine asks the game's
own scripts to apply the damage, which is the moment multiplayer uses to send it to whoever is in
charge of the target. Magic is applied by the engine itself with nothing to intercept, so there
was no such moment — and simply adding one would have made it worse, applying the damage twice.
The engine now asks, before it applies harmful magic, whether the target is somebody else's to
damage; if it is, it holds off and hands the effect to multiplayer to deliver. Single-player is
untouched.

A second fault was hiding behind the first: the code that applies an incoming spell on the
receiving side counted its effects from one where the engine counts from zero, so it would have
failed on every spell it was ever given. Nothing had ever given it one, so nobody found out.

**Attacks no longer vanish when the world is between simulators.** An area whose simulation has
momentarily gone — one restarting, or one that has not picked the area up yet — used to swallow
every attack made into it, and because your own game gives up its copy of the damage the instant
it sends, that cost you the whole swing rather than a message. Those attacks are now held for a
few seconds and land as soon as the area is being simulated again, so a restart is a moment of
lag rather than a run of attacks that did nothing. They are held in strictly bounded numbers and
only briefly: past a few seconds the fight has moved on, and landing an old blow is worse than
admitting it missed.

**Attacks the world genuinely cannot accept still say so.** That case — where the area you are fighting in
has no simulator at that moment, because one is restarting or has not picked the area up yet — is
the one most likely to look like "my hits do not register". The server discards the attack, and
it used to say nothing at all to the person who threw it, who had already lost the damage
locally. They are now told, once, in plain words. Reasons that are really about cheating stay
silent, because telling a client which check it tripped only helps it tune.

Combat events the server discards are also counted now, by reason. Every one of them is an attack
a player made that did nothing, and until now an operator asked about it had only scattered log
lines to answer with.

**Fixed: two things the server said that the game never passed on.** An event the server sends
and the client has no handler for is not an error anywhere — it arrives, matches nothing, and is
dropped in silence, so the feature looks unbuilt while the server half is finished and tested.
Resting or waiting where the world does not allow it now says so, instead of the bed simply
doing nothing and being pressed again — which matters more than it used to, because the shared
world no longer lets anyone skip time at all. And being removed from a party, or having it
disband because the leader left, is now something you are told rather than something you notice.

**Fixed: the WebAssembly engine died on every boot, in the settings window.** It got as far as
loading Morrowind, starting physics and bringing up the renderer, then stopped with a bare
"null function" and no message. The cause was localisation, not graphics: the build linked
Unicode support against a placeholder data package and never supplied the real one, so the
library that formats text had no locale data at all. Asked to put a number into a slider label —
which happens while the settings window is being built, on every start — it fetched a number
formatter, got nothing back, and called into it anyway. The data package the toolchain already
ships is now included and pointed at before anything formats a message. Two other explanations
were tested first and both were wrong; the graphics one was ruled out by reproducing the crash
identically on a completely different graphics backend, and the fault was finally reproduced in
a twelve-line program with no game engine involved at all.

**Fixed: loot that quietly went missing.** When two people reach for the same item, the loser's
game takes the item back out of their inventory — correctly, because they never got it. It said
nothing while doing so, which looks exactly like the game eating your loot. Every reason the
server can refuse a container action is now a sentence, including the one that matters most: with
party loot rolls turned on, grabbing a rare item is *supposed* to refuse and start a roll
instead, so the most interesting thing that feature does used to be indistinguishable from a bug.

**Attacks that the world could not accept now say so.** Where the server discards a hit because
the area is not being simulated at that moment — a simulation peer restarting, or one that has
not picked the area up yet — the attacker is told, once, rather than swinging into silence.
Reasons that are really about cheating are still not reported, because telling a client which
check it tripped only helps it tune.

**The social menu speaks English.** Every social action answers with a protocol code, and the
game showed you the code: inviting somebody who already had a party popped up "PartyInvite:
already_in_party", and an invite that *worked* read "PartyInvite: ok". Each of the twenty
actions now says what happened in a sentence. One code needed care rather than a lookup table —
"already in a party" is a fact about *them* when you invite and about *you* when you accept, so
sharing one sentence between the two would have made one of them false. WebRTC voice signalling
stopped narrating itself at the player entirely; a dropped offer because someone left the party
is routine, and it was interrupting the game to say so.

**The shared world has lobby rules.** Nobody can rest and fast-forward the clock for everyone
else, and PvP is on in the wilderness so there is something to do besides chat — towns, shops
and guildhalls stay places you can stand still in, and party members still cannot hit each
other. Self-hosted servers are unaffected: these apply only to the gateway's public world, and
only where the operator has not stated otherwise.

**Fair play.** An engine build can now be pinned by the operator instead of being adopted from
whoever connects first, and a client that declines to identify itself is no longer waved
through the check meant to stop it. In the public world, sustained impossible movement within a
cell stops being relayed rather than merely counted — travelling between cells is still taken on
trust, because the server has no way to tell a real door from an invented one. Drop conservation became enforceable — clients report
what they pick up as it happens, closing the timing gap that made "you cannot drop what you do
not have" unanswerable — though it stays off by default until it has been exercised against a
real engine.

**The public world tidies up after itself.** Anything strangers drop there used to stay on the
ground forever, so its saved state only ever grew and every new arrival paid to download the
accumulated rubbish. Cells that have collected something are now reset on a schedule, skipping
any a player is standing in. This is only safe because nothing in the lobby is permanent — an
item on its floor could never have become anyone's property.

**Fixed: the WebAssembly dependency stack could not be built from a clean checkout.** Eight
separate faults, each hiding the next — a missing build tool, a graphics library whose headers
were never copied, plugin targets that only built when something else had already failed, a
video library rejected as "too old" because nothing could read its version, and an audio library
rejected as too old when it was in fact eleven years newer than required. The scripts now work
end to end, which as far as we can tell they never had.

**Fixed: none of the build scripts ran on a Windows checkout.** Sixteen shell scripts and the
OpenSceneGraph patch were stored with Windows line endings, which makes a shell script fail with
an unhelpful error about an invalid option and makes the patch fail to apply at all — so the
WebAssembly dependency stack simply could not be built there, and the error pointed at the patch
rather than at the checkout. Line endings are now pinned for scripts and patches.

**Fixed: the multiplayer server image could not be built on an ordinary machine.** It let the
compiler use every core, which on a normal amount of memory runs the machine out of RAM — and
it shows up as the build silently stopping partway through rather than as an error. Build
parallelism is now capped and configurable.

**A restart no longer throws everyone out.** The server has always told its players it was
shutting down before closing their connection — but the client treated that as fatal and dropped
them into an error screen they could only escape by reloading. So every deploy ejected everyone,
and the rolling-restart machinery built to prevent exactly that had no way of helping. The
client now waits for the world to come back and puts the player where they were, and says "the
server is restarting" instead of "connection lost".

**Operators can roll worlds without an outage.** Rolling restart existed and was tested, but
nothing could ask for it — no command, no route, no signal. `SIGHUP` to the gateway now restarts
worlds one at a time, emptiest first, waiting for each to come back before touching the next.

**Every world's metrics from one place.** Worlds listen on internal ports that nothing
publishes, so per-world numbers could not be scraped from outside the container at all. The
gateway's `/metrics` now carries them.

**Teleporting around the map is bounded.** Movement checks deliberately forgive a change of cell,
because a door genuinely is a teleport — which left declaring one as a way around them. The
server cannot tell a real door from an invented one, but it does not have to: walking is always
into a neighbouring cell and doors go through interiors, so jumping across the map is a spell, a
silt strider, or a lie. Those are rare, so the rate is now limited. Walking any distance and
using doors as often as you like are untouched.

**Fixed: the world-switch loading screen dropping and coming back.** Two paths cleared the boot
screen while the destination world was still settling, so it vanished, the music started, and
it reappeared a moment later.

**The client scripts have tests now.** The browser suite needs a built engine, which is a
maintainer artifact, so changes to the in-game Lua could sit in the tree with nothing having
executed them — and a Lua mistake does not crash the game, it quietly disables one subsystem.
`wasm-build/lua-tests/` runs the real scripts against stubbed engine APIs. It does not replace
the browser suite; it means the logic has been run.

**Fixed: `wasm-build/dev-local.sh` could not start a server.** It had not been updated for two
requirements added in 1.1.0 — a server password for the simulation peer, and a peer binary — so
it died on startup. It now writes the password it needs, and picks the entry point to match what
is on the machine: the real server when a peer binary is there, the harness server when it is
not. Without a peer it says so plainly, because NPCs genuinely do not move in that mode. It can
also run the full multi-world gateway with `--gateway`, so solo/party/public switching is
exercisable locally for the first time.

**Locker uploads over 100 MB no longer fail silently.** A configured `[locker]` S3 endpoint
with missing credentials used to fall back to filesystem storage with one info line; uploads
then rode the site origin through Cloudflare, whose free-plan 100 MB body cap rejected every
BSA and voice-pack upload at the edge — invisible in server logs, while the wizard showed a
generic failure players read as "files not genuine". The server now logs
`locker.s3_creds_missing` at error level, the production deploy fails its health gate on that
event, and `docker-compose.prod.yml` actually loads the credentials file the bring-up doc
described. The upload wizard also explains the Windows/Chromium "contains system files" folder
block (default Steam installs live in `Program Files`) instead of showing a raw error.

**File-mode lockers get an upload host that bypasses the CDN.** When the locker stores blobs
on the server's own disk, presigned URLs can now point at a dedicated unproxied hostname
(`[locker] publicBase`), so big uploads no longer have to fit through a fronting proxy's body
cap. S3 mode is unaffected and still uploads directly to object storage.

## 1.1.0

The multiplayer release. 1.0.x was a single player engine in the browser. 1.1.0 adds a hosted
multiplayer service around it, a way to bring your own copy of Morrowind with you to any
machine, and a launcher that ties the two together.

If you self host, nothing here forces you into the hosted shape. Every new subsystem is off by
default and the permissive defaults are still the shipped ones.

### Multiplayer

**Worlds.** A gateway process runs in front of many world processes and hands each player to the
right one. There is a shared public world, and every player also gets a private world of their
own that starts when they dial it and is reaped when they leave. Worlds reachable through a
single port, so a world's own port never leaves the container.

**Server authoritative NPCs.** A headless OpenMW instance, the sim peer, holds cell authority and
is the only thing that simulates actors. One peer covers every occupied cell, with interiors
anchored so a peer is not spawned per room.

**Identity.** Sign in with Google, Discord or Microsoft. Accounts are keyed on (issuer, subject)
and never on email, because providers reassign email and keying on it would hand one player's
character to another. No email scope is requested. First login picks a public handle, and your
real name is never shown.

**Characters.** Accounts own character slots. Player state is keyed per character, so your
progress follows the character and not the account.

**Social.** Friends, parties, whisper, chat with history so a room reads as inhabited, presence
that spans worlds so a friend in their own world does not read as offline, and party voice over
a WebRTC mesh scoped to the party.

**Party play.** Parties persist across worlds and across restarts. The leader can move the whole
group to another world in one action. Party difficulty scaling, and loot rules with a roll UI.

A guest in someone else's world keeps what they carry out — items, skills and levels are
theirs — but the QUEST LOG belongs to the world's owner. You advance the campaign you are
visiting, and your own story is neither moved nor spoiled by the visit.

**Quests.** Instance owned journals with the guest journal stashed and restored, durable quest
steps, non depleting quest items, and a whitelist for the quests that are safe to share.

**Moderation and fair play.** An anti cheat envelope on declared state, PvP zoning, persistent
mutes and blocks, a report flow, a web admin dashboard, and an in game console that is disabled
in multiplayer.

### Cloud locker

Upload your own Morrowind once and it streams back to you on any machine you sign in from,
including your saves. Per account isolation with no deduplication, so no player's files are ever
served to anyone else. Uploads are checked against a manifest generated from the server's own
game data and sniffed after upload, so unrelated files are refused rather than stored.

There is now a single player tile for this as well. Same account, same locker, same uploaded
files, with multiplayer simply not booting. Upload once, play anywhere, on your own.

### Savegames

Saves are stored on the server and follow your account. Multiplayer saves and cloud locker saves
are kept in separate namespaces and cannot appear in each other's load screens. The server falls
back to its own disk when no S3 bucket is configured.

### Launcher

A rebuilt front page with a tile per way in, a themed sign in modal showing every configured
provider, a first visit upload wizard with a multi file picker and an ownership gate, and help on
each tile rather than a wall of text.

### Operators

- One container image runs the gateway and the sim peer together, with the peer binary auto probed.
- Linux sim peer builds, so tier 2 is deployable.
- `simPeer` mode can be `auto`, `on` or `off`, with a start deadline.
- Bucket CORS is registered from the deployment's own origin.
- Strict content mode is real: per file SHA-256 closes the tampering hole.
- Optional CRM capture on signup.
- Development bots that hold accounts and characters, accept friend and party invites, and stand
  where players begin. Off unless enabled, and the server now says loudly at boot when they are
  running, because they register real accounts and reserve real handles.

### Security and reliability

The pre release hardening pass. Several of these were found by probing a running deployment
rather than by reading code, and are listed plainly because they were real:

- The per IP login limit was one bucket for the entire server, because the client address was
  read from the socket and behind a reverse proxy that is always the proxy. The sixth person to
  sign in within a minute was refused. Client addresses are now resolved through a single trust
  boundaried helper.
- A client could forge its own address past the proxy and get a fresh login budget, evade an IP
  ban and evade the per address connection cap. The edge now strips client supplied address
  headers, and the server trusts the gateway's stamp only from loopback. `CF-Connecting-IP` is
  ignored unless a deployment opts in with `[limits] trustCloudflareIp`.
- A private world revived after being reaped came back with no owner, which every access check
  read as "public, admit anyone". Any signed in account could enter another player's world. The
  owner is now recorded beside the world and recovered on revival, and a world that cannot be
  attributed is not started.
- The shared social database was the only store opened without a busy timeout, and it threw from
  inside a timer, which exits the process. Two populated worlds was enough to eject everyone in
  one of them.
- Two worlds booting at the same moment could both run the same migration, and the loser died at
  startup.
- The gateway had no crash handlers and left its worlds running when it died, holding the ports
  the next gateway then tried to use.
- Party membership was cached per process and never invalidated, so a member who left in one
  world stayed a member in another, kept appearing in the panel, and stayed reachable by voice.
- Inviting someone created a party of one immediately, which made the inviter uninvitable by
  anyone else if the invite was never accepted.
- A promotion or an unban could be silently rolled back by the next character mutation.
- Absurd declared inventory and level changes are now refused rather than only counted, and
  combat is bounded by a per attacker rate limit and a proximity check.

Known and deliberate: the server does not compute damage, because armour, resistances and
difficulty live in game data the server process does not load. The victim's client applies the
hit, and the server bounds shape, rate and proximity rather than truth. Position is client
authored on the same terms.

### Notes for operators upgrading

- A hosted deployment should set `[auth] requireSso = true`. It forces password login off. The
  shipped default stays permissive for self hosters, and the front door now warns at boot when
  SSO providers are configured while password login is still accepted.
- A deployment behind Cloudflare must set `[limits] trustCloudflareIp = true`. Leaving it off
  behind Cloudflare makes every player resolve to the edge address, which collapses every per IP
  limit into one global bucket. The active mode is logged at boot as `net.client_ip_mode`.

## 1.0.2 and earlier

Single player OpenMW in the browser: the engine compiled to WebAssembly, the demo content, the
rendering and performance work, and the launcher that boots it. See the git history for detail.
