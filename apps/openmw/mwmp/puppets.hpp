// WHO OWNS AN ACTOR'S DAMAGE, asked synchronously from C++.
//
// In multiplayer an actor a remote peer simulates is a PUPPET here: its position and stats are
// pushed to us, and anything we do to it locally is a guess that the owner will overwrite. For
// MELEE that is already handled in Lua — the engine hands damage application to
// `omw/combat/local.lua` via the `Hit` event, so `scripts/mp/puppet.lua` intercepts it, returns
// false to cancel, and forwards the raw attack to the owner.
//
// MAGIC HAS NO SUCH SEAM. `mwmechanics/spelleffects.cpp` applies harmful effects in C++ with
// `adjustDynamicStat`, and the only Lua notification on that path (`Class::onHit`) returns void
// and is queued, so a script cannot veto it. The result was that spell damage never travelled:
// the caster's client damaged its own puppet copy, the owner never heard, and the health bar
// snapped back on the next stats push. Casting at anything did nothing.
//
// This is the missing seam, and it is deliberately a QUERY rather than a callback: the damage
// site needs an answer in the same call, and LuaManager's event path is asynchronous. Lua marks
// puppets as it attaches and detaches them; the damage site asks, skips its local application,
// and leaves the effect here for Lua to drain and forward on the next frame.
