# fetch-deps.sh — populate deps/src/ from upstream so build-deps.sh has something to build.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. build-deps.sh says its sources are "expected under deps/src/ (already in the
# tree)" — but deps/ is gitignored, and NOTHING put them there. So a clean `git clone` could not
# build this project at all: restage-inputs.sh states it outright ("a git checkout ALONE cannot
# produce a buildable tree"), and the only way to get sources was to copy ~750MB out of band from
# a builder's ~/build-artifacts or somebody's existing tree.
#
# That gap has a cost beyond onboarding. The audio outage this fixed a version of was exactly
# this shape: build-deps.sh had the mp3/vorbis decoders enabled for months while the SHIPPED
# libavcodec.a predated the change, because the built artifact travelled out of band and the
# source fix did not. A dependency you cannot rebuild from a clone is one you will eventually
# ship stale without noticing.
#
# WHAT IS AND IS NOT PUBLISHABLE. The "not ours to publish" note on deps/ is correct for RETAIL
# game data — that stays out, and the bring-your-own-Morrowind path exists for it. It is not true
# of the dependency sources: OSG, Jolt Physics, Recast, MyGUI, FFmpeg, Boost, Lua and LZ4 are all open
# source and freely fetchable. Downloading them needs no permission from anyone.
#
# USAGE
#   wasm-build/fetch-deps.sh              # fetch anything missing
#   wasm-build/fetch-deps.sh --force      # re-fetch even if present
#   wasm-build/fetch-deps.sh osg lua      # just these
#
# Then:
#   wasm-build/build-deps.sh              # compile them into deps/wasm/
#
# PINNED, NOT "LATEST". Every version below is the one this tree is known to build against; the
# git ones are pinned to a TAG rather than a branch. An unpinned dependency stack reproduces a
# different bug every time it is fetched.
