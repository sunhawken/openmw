# CMake/ninja can compile everything (`ninja -C build-wasm64 components openmw-lib` +
# `ninja -C build-wasm64 apps/openmw/CMakeFiles/openmw.dir/main.cpp.o`), but the final link
# needs runtime flags (preload FS, pthread pool, WebGL2, IDBFS...) that break CMake's
# configure-time checks, so it is done out-of-band by this script.
#
# Usage:
#   ROOT=/path/to/CS-Web ./wasm-build/link-openmw.sh
# Produces build-wasm64/openmw.{js,wasm,data}; deploy with:
#   cp build-wasm64/openmw.js build-wasm64/openmw.wasm build-wasm64/openmw.data play/
#
# GOTCHAS (learned the hard way):
# - main.cpp.o is passed directly on the link line and is NOT rebuilt by
#   `ninja components openmw-lib` — build it explicitly (done below).
# - Killing this link mid-run leaves a MISMATCHED openmw.js/openmw.wasm pair; always
#   check both mtimes match before deploying.
# - Whole stack is -fwasm-exceptions (LEGACY wasm EH). Do NOT add -flto (wasm-ld
#   crashes / miscompiles boot) and do NOT set -sWASM_LEGACY_EXCEPTIONS=0.
# - ICU must be the -mt sysroot variants; hand-built deps must be compiled -pthread.

#   WebAssembly.Memory(): If shared is true, maximum property should be defined.

# guess. V8 caps wasm64 memory at 16 GiB and rejects anything above it:
#   Property 'maximum': value 278528 is above the upper bound      (17 GiB)
# Declaring the maximum costs nothing at runtime -- it is a virtual reservation, growth stays
# lazy, and a 16 GiB maximum with a 1-page initial creates instantly. A machine without the RAM
# still fails at its own physical limit, which play/index.html:3373 already reports properly;
# a lower cap here would just make it fail EARLIER, on an invented boundary.

# ICU DATA. The emscripten ICU port links `libicu_stubdata` — ICU's "data supplied elsewhere"
# placeholder — and ships the actual package under ports/icu without linking it. Nothing was
# supplying it, so ICU had NO locale data: NumberFormat::createInstance returned null and
# MessageFormat::format called a virtual on it, which is a bare `RuntimeError: null function`
# in wasm. The engine died in SettingsWindow's constructor on every single boot.
#
# main.cpp points ICU here with u_setDataDirectory("/icu") under __EMSCRIPTEN__; this stages the
# package it reads. Copied from the emsdk cache rather than committed: it is ~28 MB of upstream
# build output, and it belongs in the same category as the rest of deps/.
# Three places it can come from, in order. The emsdk cache is only populated where the ICU
# port has actually been built, and the prebaked builder image (openmw-builder64:1) does NOT
# carry it -- the data is staged into the source tree instead, which is the convention
# ci/jenkins/build-engine.sh asserts on and sync-to-builder.sh restages from
# ~/build-artifacts. Looking only in the cache made this script fail every build on the
# build server while passing on a laptop with a warm emsdk -- so accept a pre-staged copy
# and fall back to the cache, rather than the other way round.

# The finding is real (28.6 MB of a 32 MB openmw.data, for six locales and a MessageFormat), but
# the naive TOC filter is NOT a safe way to get it, and this was proven by running it:
#
#   With the trim, the engine boots normally all the way to "Reserving texture unit for sky RTT"
#   and then dies with `unhandled rejection: null function`. Restoring the full package with every
#   other change in place boots clean. Bisected: dropping FEATURE GROUPS (coll/zone/curr/...) alone
#   is fine; dropping other LOCALES is what breaks it.
#
# Why: the package still contains ICU's locale INDEX resources, which continue to advertise the
# ~800 locales whose .res entries were removed. ICU opens one, gets nothing back, and calls a
# virtual on the null -- the same bare "null function" this data caused when it was absent
# entirely. Filtering the built .dat cannot fix that; the index has to be regenerated, which is
# exactly what upstream's ICU_DATA_FILTER_FILE does and what the script's header wrongly dismissed.
#
# To land this properly: build the ICU data with ICU_DATA_FILTER_FILE (needs a native ICU build in
# the deps stack), or extend trim-icu-data.py to rewrite res_index.res for every kept tree. Until
# then ship the full package -- 26 MB is worth having, but not at the cost of a boot crash.
