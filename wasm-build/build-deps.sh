# build-deps.sh — rebuild the ENTIRE WASM dependency stack from source in deps/src/ into
# deps/wasm/{lib,include}. This is the end-to-end recipe that previously only existed ad-hoc
# (only OSG was scripted). Consolidates the standard emscripten cross-compiles + the flags
# documented in README.md §"Dependency stack".
#
# Sources expected under deps/src/ (already in the tree): osg (patched), recast, mygui,
# ffmpeg-6.1.2, boost_1_85_0, lua-5.4.7, lz4-1.10.0. Emscripten PORTS provide the rest
# (SDL2/FreeType/HarfBuzz/png/jpeg/zlib/ogg/vorbis at link time; ICU + libGL-getprocaddr into the
# sysroot; OpenAL is emscripten's built-in — we only stage an empty `openal_stub` to satisfy CMake).
#
# Usage:
#   ROOT=/path/to/repo EM_LIBEXEC=/path/to/emscripten/libexec ./wasm-build/build-deps.sh [target...]
#   (no target => build everything, in order)   e.g. ./wasm-build/build-deps.sh recast lua
#
# NOTE: I authored this from the standard emscripten build patterns + the README flags and could NOT
# compile-test it here. The from-source builds most likely to need a round of iteration on the target
# toolchain are marked  ### VERIFY ###  (Boost b2 toolset, MyGUI FreeType wiring, the ICU/GL ports).
# All wasm .a archives are ABI-stable across emscripten patch versions.

# --- WASM64 (MEMORY64) -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# OFF by default: the wasm32 stack in deps/wasm and everything that reads it stay exactly as they
# were, so this is reversible by unsetting one variable rather than by rebuilding.
# The stack builds into deps/wasm64; wasm32 is no longer a target (OMW_WASM64=0 refuses).
#
# -m64, NOT -sMEMORY64=1: emscripten 6.0.1 accepts both but warns the -s spelling is deprecated
# ("prefer the standard -m64 or --target=wasm64 flags"). -m64 is a clang-style flag, so unlike a
# linker setting it reaches CMake try_compile probes the same way -msimd128 and -pthread do --
# which matters here because half this file drives CMake.
#
# A wasm64 archive and a wasm32 archive CANNOT be mixed: wasm-ld refuses the link outright. That
# is the good failure mode, and it is why the two stacks live in separate prefixes rather than
# overwriting one another.
#
# ffmpeg keeps --arch=$WASM_ARCH as a LABEL only: --disable-asm is already set, so it selects
# generic C paths either way. Its real pointer size comes from -m64, which must be passed to
# BOTH --extra-cflags and --extra-ldflags (see build_ffmpeg). ffmpeg prints
# "WARNING: unknown architecture wasm64" and falls back to generic C -- that warning is
# expected and is not the reason for any failure.
